description: Setting up an integration with Amazon Web Services S3
---

The AWS S3 integration supports loading catalog entities from an S3 Bucket.
Entities can be added to
[static catalog configuration](../../features/software-catalog/configuration.md),
or registered with the
[catalog-import](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/plugins/catalog-import)
plugin.

## Configuration

To use this integration, add configuration to your root `app-config.yaml`:

```yaml
integrations:
  awsS3:
    accessKeyID: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
    secretAccessKey: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
```

Then make sure the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are set when you run Backstage.
